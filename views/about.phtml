                        3D Gaussian splatting is an advanced technique for representing and rendering complex
                        three-dimensional scenes. Rather than relying solely on traditional polygonal meshes, this
                        approach utilizes collections of overlapping, smoothly blended Gaussian "splats" to define
                        the geometry and appearance of objects or environments.

                        By distributing spatially varying Gaussian functions throughout 3D space, this method
                        effectively captures subtle surface details, handles transparency and semi-opaque materials,
                        and produces smooth transitions between different parts of a scene. Moreover, Gaussian
                        splatting enables data-driven rendering, allowing for adaptive levels of detail and highly
                        realistic visualizations, even for intricate and detailed models.
